# COMP551miniproject2
Mini project 2 for COMP 551 Applied Machine Learning at McGill University

For this project we were tasked to fit different models from scikit learn to two text classification problems. The 20 news group data set is multi-class and the Imbd data set is binary.
We are tasked to create a model validation pipeline and to evaluate the effects of tuning
hyper parameters on the models. In the end we found that LinearSVC, the linear support
vector machine model for classification problems, works best for both of the data sets. Our
final test accuracies are 0.90424 for IMBD and 0.705 for 20 News Group.
